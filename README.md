# TextTwister

This game was inspired by TextTwist and made as a "hackathon" project for my AP Computer Science A class. The game can
be run from the `GUI` class.

To play, either type or click on the letters to enter letters of the word to guess based off of the letters and boxes
given. You can use `backspace` to undo your typing/selection. Press `enter` to input your guess.

To shuffle the given letters' order, either click on "Shuffle" or press the `space` key. To get the previous word you
entered, press the `down` arrow key.

If you give up, click on the "Give up" button, and it will reveal the words you missed. You can click "Restart"
afterwards to play again.

Have fun! I will maybe update this to look better in the future.

(if you have any issues please let me know!)

### Todo for the future (very optimistic)

- Refactor code (code written by high school me was not very good) + optimization
- Fix styling
- Use a better dictionary/pull a dictionary with an API
- Add difficulty levels/use hints to make the game more user-friendly or fun
- Add multiplayer (see who can find the most words, will be the most difficult)
